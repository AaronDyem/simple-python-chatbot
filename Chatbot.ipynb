    "## **Simple Tech Training Chatbot – Your Virtual Guide to Bluehouse Technologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "Looking for a quick and convenient way to get information about tech training programs? This simple chatbot is designed to assist users by providing instant responses to inquiries about Bluehouse Technologies' training programs, costs, duration, and contact details. Built using Python, this chatbot follows a rule-based approach, mapping predefined user inputs to relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "The chatbot recognizes specific user queries and provides appropriate responses based on a predefined dictionary of questions and answers. It supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Greeting Responses – Recognizes greetings like \"hello,\" \"hi,\" \"good morning,\" and more.\n",
    "- ✅ Tech Training Information – Provides details on courses like web development, data science, mobile app development, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.\n",
    "- ✅ Training Costs & Duration – Answers questions about pricing and program lengths.\n",
    "- ✅ Contact Information – Guides users on how to get in touch with Bluehouse Technologies.\n",
    "- ✅ Help Command – Suggests topics the chatbot can assist with if the user's input is unclear.\n",
    "- ✅ Fallback Handling – Responds with a default message when an unrecognized query is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Plan**\n",
    "Define the Chatbot's Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot is tailored for answering FAQs about Bluehouse Technologies' training programs.\n",
    "Implement a Rule-Based Response System\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary (responses) maps user inputs to predefined answers.\n",
    "Develop the Chatbot Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.\n",
    "Check for exact matches and partial keyword matches (e.g., \"trainings,\" \"cost,\" \"duration\").\n",
    "Provide appropriate responses or suggest available commands when input is unclear.\n",
    "Test the Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Run different queries to ensure correct responses.\n",
    "Enhance & Deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand the chatbot's response library.\n",
    "Integrate with a web or messaging platform for real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete Python implementation of the chatbot, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ The response dictionary for handling user queries.\n",
    "- ✅ The logic for processing user input and selecting appropriate responses.\n",
    "- ✅ A simple command-line interface for user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're a beginner exploring chatbot development or a tech enthusiast looking to automate responses, this project provides a solid foundation for building an interactive FAQ chatbot.\n",
